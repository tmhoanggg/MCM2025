## Overview
__Problem C:__ Models for Olympic Medal Tables
This study focuses on using the \textbf{Prophet} model to predict the medal table for the \textbf{2028 Los Angeles Olympics}, along with the corresponding prediction intervals. We then apply \textbf{KMeans} clustering to identify countries that show significant changes in their medal counts. Additionally, we use \textbf{Negative Binomial Regression} to examine the relationship between the number of events a country participates in and the number of medals they win, and assess this relationship using \textbf{Pearson Correlation} coefficients. We also apply \textbf{Network Analysis} to identify key sports for prominent countries in various Olympic Games. The study includes visualizations to uncover insights such as the impact of the host country, gender equality, and Japan's investment in the Olympics. We also utilize \textbf{Randomized Inference} to test and estimate the contribution of the "great coach" effect on medal counts. Finally, we compiled our findings into a memorandum to send to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), highlighting the key insights from our research.
